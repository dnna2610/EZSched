# EZSched
This was a freshmen project that I worked on with 2 other friends in Drexel. 
We set out to make a website that helps student to make their term schedule before registering.
I worked on scraping the school website to get the data of the courses. 
Unfortunately, we were unable to get it up and running in the duration of the course.
So I put my codes here, hoping one day I'll come back and complete it.
