Drexel students.

Cheng Chen - Output

The below is only summary of my part.

Approach 1:
Use MySQL to develop a database.
We did made a small database using Putty.
Problem - the database is too big, takes too long to get information and requires
constant updates.

Approach 2:
Use php and simple_html_dom libraries to get the information directly from the school
website at runtime.
2 steps: 
1. Get the correct link - done.
2. Get info from the site - not yet done.

Issues:
The link is correct but the DOM Object is loading the wrong site.
Possibly a memory leak but the clear() does not seem to work. Still working on this.
